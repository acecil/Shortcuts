Shortcuts: A shortcut utility written by Andrew Gascoyne-Cecil.

Shortcuts is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

To show or hide the Shorcuts application enter the global shortcut Win + Q.
Shortcuts displays a list of shortcuts matching a search string for the application that has the focus. Hopefully this tool is useful for learning shortcuts for applications and executing less commonly used commands without searching through menus.

Shortcuts relies on configuration files to display shortcuts for each application. Currently supported applications are Windows Explorer, Visual Studio 2005, Google Chrome and Firefox.
